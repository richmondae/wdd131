      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My family and I love to travel for weeks at a time.  Our favorite ways to spend time in nature is to explore the national parks.  They are an endless source of beauty.  No park is the same.  Each has it’s own story of how it formed and how it came to be protected in the national park system.  
        Visitors to my site will be able to see beautiful nature pictures and learn about where they can go to see them in person as well as route ideas from our travel blog for putting together a trip. Let's Travel!
